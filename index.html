          <h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
          <p>
            What would Paris be without its symbolic Eiffel Tower? Built by
            Gustave Eiffel to commemorate the centenary of the French
            Revolution, it is presented at the Exposition Universelle in Paris
            in 1889. 324 meters high, it is one of the most visited monuments in
            the world with nearly 7 million visitors a year.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first floor houses the Eiffel Tower 58 which extends over two
            levels, 58 meters above the ground as its name suggests. On the
            second floor, the view is the best at 115 meters because you have a
            diving view on the ground below. Finally on the 3rd floor at 275
            meters, you can see what the office of Gustave Eiffel was. For the
            more adventurous one, it is possible to use the stairs and climb the
            steps (1,665 to the summit).

          <h1>Notre Dame Cathedral</h1>
          <p>
            One of the most enduring symbols of Paris: Notre-Dame de Paris, also
            known as Notre Dame, a Roman Catholic cathedral is located on the
            eastern half of the Ile de la Cité. It is widely considered one of
            the finest examples of French Gothic architecture in France and
            Europe. Begun in 1163 and completed in 1345, this cathedral is a
            sight with its portals surrounded by his many sculptures and
            gargoyles that adorn the roof.
          </p>
          <p>
            We advise you to walk around the cathedral, then go inside and climb
            the 387 steps to the top of the towers. The climb to the top of the
            towers can be exhausting, but you will get a panoramic view of the
            region and see the famous gargoyles up close.

          <h1>Palace of Versailles</h1>
          <p>
            The Château de Versailles is the most famous castle in France. Built
            in the 17th century as a symbol of military power of France and as a
            demonstration of French supremacy in Europe, Versailles was the seat
            of political power in the Kingdom of France from 1682 to 1789. This
            huge complex of buildings, gardens and terraces is definitely a must
            for any visitor who will be captivated by exceptional
            accommodations, lavish decorations, furniture and gilded works of
            Renaissance art.
